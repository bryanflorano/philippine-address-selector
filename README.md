# Philippine Address Selector

This project provides a dynamic, cascading dropdown address selectorthat enables users to select an address step-by-step: starting with a region, followed by a province, city/municipality, and barangay. The dropdowns are dynamically populated using data stored in JSON files.


## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the address selector form.
- `philippine_address_selector.js`: JavaScript logic for loading data, handling events, and updating dropdowns.
- `data/`: Directory containing the JSON files (`regions.json`, `provinces.json`, `cities.json`, and `barangays.json`).
